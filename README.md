# TextClassification

The idea for this kind of classification is from tensorflow website: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification

In this website basic text classification is made for film reviews.

I applied different approach - used Recurential Neural Networks, changed the way of textVectorization to the encoder from keras module and added saved model with more epochs.

This programe is only modificated version of excercise from tensorflow website.
